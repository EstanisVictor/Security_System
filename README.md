<h3>College Security Systems subject content</h3>

1 - Botnet SSH with brute force: A botnet is a network of compromised computers that can be controlled remotely. SSH is a protocol used to securely connect to a remote computer. A brute force attack is when an attacker tries many different passwords until they find the correct one. So, a botnet SSH with brute force attack is when a botnet is used to repeatedly try different passwords to gain access to a remote computer using SSH.

2 - Port scanner: An exploiter of ports is a tool that scans a network for open ports, which are like doors into a computer system. Once an open port is found, an attacker can try to exploit it by sending malicious code or gaining unauthorized access to the system.

3 - FTP service injection: FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol, which is a way of transferring files between computers. FTP service injection is a technique where an attacker sends malicious code to a computer running an FTP service, with the goal of taking control of the computer or stealing sensitive information.

4 - ZIP file password cracking and email sending: ZIP files are used to compress and package files together for easier transfer. If a ZIP file is password protected, an attacker can use a password cracking tool to try many different passwords until the correct one is found. Once the file is unlocked, the attacker could then potentially steal information or install malware. Additionally, an attacker could email the unlocked file to themselves or another person to further spread the attack.

5 - Unix password cracking: Unix is an operating system used on many servers and workstations. Password cracking on a Unix system involves trying many different passwords until the correct one is found, allowing the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system and potentially steal or modify sensitive data.
